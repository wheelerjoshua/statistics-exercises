    "1. How likely is it that you roll doubles when rolling two dice?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If you flip 8 coins, what is the probability of getting exactly 3 heads? What is the probability of getting more than 3 heads?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. There are approximitely 3 web development cohorts for every 1 data science cohort at Codeup. Assuming that Codeup randomly selects an alumni to put on a billboard, what are the odds that the two billboards I drive past both have data science students on them?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Codeup students buy, on average, 3 poptart packages with a standard deviation of 1.5 a day from the snack vending machine. If on monday the machine is restocked with 17 poptart packages, how likely is it that I will be able to buy some poptarts on Friday afternoon? (Remember, if you have mean and standard deviation, use the np.random.normal)\n",

    "5. Compare Heights\n",
    "\n",
    "- Men have an average height of 178 cm and standard deviation of 8cm.\n",
    "- Women have a mean of 170, sd = 6cm.\n",
    "- Since you have means and standard deviations, you can use np.random.normal to generate observations.\n",
    "- If a man and woman are chosen at random, P(woman taller than man)?\n",

    "6. When installing anaconda on a student's computer, there's a 1 in 250 chance that the download is corrupted and the installation fails. What are the odds that after having 50 students download anaconda, no one has an installation issue? 100 students?\n",
